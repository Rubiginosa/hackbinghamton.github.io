On behalf of the HackBU team, I am excited to announce that [signups for the HackBU 2023 hackathon](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GANiL5gH3OvpN1NBtq7epuL2RSFfitVxYH351ByBfu0/edit) are now open! This event will take place on **February 4th-5th, in-person at Binghamton University's Innovative Technology Complex**. If you are interested, regular registration will close at midnight on Sunday, January 22nd.

<!--more-->

This will be our tenth annual hackathon, and our first in-person event of this size since HackBU 2020. The hackathon is a 24-hour event in which you build a project from the ground up in the language and technology of your choosing. We highly recommend that students of all backgrounds get involved, regardless of skill level! If you feel unconfident programming, we will be hosting workshops that go over programming with Python and presenting ideas with web development.

Thanks to our sponsors, we will be providing free food and free swag to all of our attendees (this year's swag color is purple!). There will also be many opportunities to network and attend talks from our affiliates.
